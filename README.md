# Project Overview

Welcome to my project! If you're reading this, it means you're interested in learning more about it.

## Introduction

This project has a very basic design and limited functionality, but it's a start.

## Navbar

The navigation bar at the top consists of 3 buttons:

1. **Home:** This section contains the actual plots and budgeting features.
2. **About:** You're currently reading this section.
3. **Login:** Where you can log in (supposedly).

## Budgeting Section

The budgeting section comprises of 3 main components:

1. **Setting Initial Budget:** Initially fixed due to issues with updating (especially with the "over budget" logic).
2. **Adding Expenses:** Enter expenses with a name and amount.
3. **Visualization:** A pie chart that visualizes expenses. Additional plots may be added in the future.

## Login Section

The login section consists of 2 components:

1. **Login Component:** Performs a check to a MySQL database for exact username and password matches, redirecting to the home page upon success.
2. **Signup Page:** Includes typical username, password, and confirm password fields.

## Conclusion

Though the project may not be perfect, it's a work in progress and serves its purpose.
